        "The study of network robustness is critical to the understanding of complex interconnected systems. For example, consider an example of a power grid network that is susceptible to both natural failures and targeted attacks. A natural failure occurs when a single power substation fails due to erosion of parts or natural disasters. However, when one substation fails, additional load is routed to alternative substations, potentially causing a series of cascading failures. Not all failures originate from natural causes, some come from targeted attacks, such as enemy states hacking into the grid to sabotage key equipment to maximally damage the operations of the electrical grid. A natural counterpart to network robustness is vulnerability, defined as measure of a network’s susceptibility to the dissemination of entities across the network, such as how quickly a virus spreads across a computer network.\n",

        "\n",
        "- the **capacity** of each node (<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_v\">) in the network, e.g., power substation capacity.\n",

        "- network **redundancy** (*r*) representing the amount of reserve capacity present in the network i.e., auxiliary support systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a node is attacked it becomes \"overloaded\", causing it to fail and requiring the load be distributed to its neighbors. When defending a node, we increase it’s capacity to protect against attacks. With just these 3 parameters, we can setup a cascading failure simulation. Below, we show how to load a graph representing the U.S. electrical grid and setup the simulation parameters."

Each node in the SIS model can be in one of two states, infected *I* or susceptible *S*, and at each time step *t*, an infected node has a probability *β* of infecting each of it's uninfected neighbors. After this, each infected node has a probability *δ* of healing and becoming susceptible again.\n",
